                    <h1>About TWRC</h1>
                    <h2>From a long-running high school club to a 501(c)3 non-profit:</h2>
                    <p>We’re a new generation of students with a shared passion; model rocketry competitions, of course, but also with shared values of teaching and learning, succeeding and persevering, competing and leading. We realized we had the opportunity to take the skills we’d learned to the next level. Now we’re working not only to support the sport in our community, but to inspire our community towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and create future leaders to change the world.</p>
                    <p>The Woodlands Rocketry Club started as a club at The Academy of Science and Technology at College Park High School called “Retrograde Cowboys”, also the club’s team name for The American Rocketry Challenge. Through the COVID years and beyond, there were always obstacles to the club’s simple goals to meet, build some rockets, and have a blast (no pun intended). However, the 2022-2023 school year saw a change in the group; we felt invigorated to reach new heights with our craft, and so The Woodlands Rocketry Club was founded. </p>
                    <p>As an educational non-profit looking to create young leaders, our organization is student-led and always looking for ways to benefit education in our area. We’re finding students with histories of leadership, community involvement, and a commitment to learning and exploring new things, even if they might be hard or confusing challenges. Our standard is to never back down from an opportunity to learn or make things better for those around us.</p>
